Project Details
$2.00 – 8.00 CAD per hour

 Bidding ends in 6 days, 23 hours
I have a fresh WordPress install running the Ultima (Qodeinteractive) theme and WP Bakery is already in place. Nothing in the theme or its code base may be rebuilt, and no extra plugins or FTP access will be granted unless we talk first.

Theme: https://ultima.qodeinteractive.com/
Layout: https://xd.adobe.com/view/cb047a85-5816-42a1-b58a-29fbba1755f2-9e57/

What I need
• Approximately 20 separate pages created so they look pixel-perfect against the Adobe XD link I’ve supplied (match the layouts exactly, not “close enough”).
• Each developer will receive a copy of the Excel sheet that lists every page. Please fill in your proposed cost and turnaround time for each line item; that sheet is what I will use to divide and award work.
NOTE: For the Home page, we will require a plugin that will display a specific article, that can be managed by the admin. Just like a module, the purpose of this is to allow the admin to control content across WP MultiSites

Practical details
– Everything is done inside WP Bakery.
– The staging site is already running; you’ll receive a WordPress login as soon as I confirm your slot.
– No theme rebuilds, child-theme tweaks, or plugin installs without prior approval.
– Multiple freelancers will be hired so we can deliver fast, so accuracy and clear time estimates matter.

When you reply, include the project password WAFER in your first message and attach the completed spreadsheet so I can lock in your pages right away.
