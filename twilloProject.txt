Looking for a full-stack developer to build a simple web app where users can receive AI-generated voice calls.
The system should let users sign up, answer a few onboarding questions for personalization, set a preferred time, and receive automated calls with short voice messages. The app should also include subscription billing and a minimal dashboard.
This is an MVP — the goal is simplicity, reliability, and clean code, not complex UI or chat features.

⚙️ Core Features
User Onboarding
Name, phone number, timezone auto-detect, and preferred time.
Ask 3–4 short questions.
Store answers to personalize future voice content.
AI Voice Call System
Calls users automatically via Twilio (or similar) at their selected time.
Plays a short voice message chosen from stored content based on their answers/mood.
Logs each call (answered / missed / failed).
Missed Call Handling
If a call is missed, send a friendly SMS offering retry or reschedule.
User Dashboard (Web)
Clean, minimal dashboard showing past messages and status.
Option to change time, preferences, or manage billing.
Subscription & Billing
Stripe integration for recurring payments.
Users can start with a trial, then upgrade to a paid plan.
Calls are active only with an active subscription.
